# Gameboy Emulator

Hi! This is a personal project I've been woking on for a while. This emulator doesn't have a name yet. Also it's not nearly finished but I'm working on it !

## This was caused when I was messing around with SDL2 trying to solve multiple graphic bugs and performance issues

## Weird glitch that I (re)discovered recently: if adress 0xFF0F (controls register) reads 0x00 instead of 0x83, this happens:  (with Tetris)

The emulator cannot go any further as of right now because I haven't implemented the controls yet.
